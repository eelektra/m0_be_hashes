# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

I struggled with the last coding instruction where you have to use the each method to iterate over an array with a condition.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

My note-taking during class have saved me several times especially when we were learning the Gitflow and GitHub processes.  

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

 I always try to solve it myself first then ruby-docs, then Google.
